    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>My interest in design started at the age of around twelve years old. Back then, I read a lot of
            comics
            and played games, and after a while I started creating and drawing my own comics and gaming
            characters. </strong> <br><br>

        My interest in design grew stronger and stronger during that period in my life. When I was seventeen years
        old I
        started studying “Graphic Design” at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, and after four enjoyable years, I finally
        graduated and received my diploma. In those four years we had multiple courses in Web Design (HTML & CSS),
        and
        although it was just the basics, it was enough for me to say that I wanted to become a Web Designer, and
        therefore I decided to do one extra year of studying after having graduated. This extra year was specialised
        in
        “Interactive Design”, whereby I learned more and more about Web Design and HTML & CSS, receiving my second
        diploma one year later.<br><br>

        Even after that extra year of studies, I wanted to learn more. This is why I started studying “Creative
        Media
        and Game Technologies” at Hogeschool Rotterdam, and a whole new world opened up for me. I learnt more than
        only
        simple HTML & CSS, having created my own websites in PHP, my own games in Typescript, played around in
        frameworks like Laravel, worked on projects to make airports around the world more smart and stepped into
        the
        world of IOT. My education gave me the freedom to search for what I wanted to be, and I want to be an
        Front-End
        Developer.<br><br>

        In addition, I’ve learned to work in sprints and the use of user stories and to appreciate the use of
        brainstorms, concepts, prototyping and testing.<br><br>

        Right now, I’m a second year student and looking for an internship as a Front-End Developer. I have basic
        knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript and PHP, and I’m eager to learn new techniques, frameworks,
        and
        programming languages.<br><br>

            <img src="img/allintheboxx.jpg">

            <h4>Project</h4>
            <p>This was my first project in PHP. We had to develop a website that was linked to a database, and
                search
                for legitimate companies to make this website for.
            </p>

            <h4>Final version</h4>
            <p>I created reservation website for All in the Boxx - a company who provides rap and hip hop workshops.
                Customers can read what All in the Boxx is all about and ultimately they are able to make a
                reservation,
                which are then stored in a database. All in the box has their own private section of the website
                where
                they can manage said reservations. The website is set up in HTML, CSS and PHP</p>

            <img src="img/ljvw.png">

            <h4>Project</h4>
            <p>I wanted to make my own portfolio website, the initial purpose of which is as support to find a
                internship. However I want it to be an on-going project, through having everything I learn about in
                the
                future being integrated into this portfolio website … See it as my own little playground!
            </p>

            <h4>Final version</h4>
            <p>I’ve chosen to use the “Mobile First” principal. So I created the mobile version first and after that
                I
                developed it for desktop and laptop usage. Lately I’ve been playing around with Flexbox, which was
                also
                used for my Portfolio website. The website is set up in HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h4>Project</h4>
            <p>We developed a game in Typescript. with the freedom to make what we wanted, with the exception of a
                few
                requirements.
            </p>

            <h4>Uitwerking</h4>
            <p>As a fan of the game Mortal Kombat, I created a game about Ermac (a playable character in Mortal
                Kombat).
                Ermac will be sent to space to take control of an airship and In this airship he has to conquer his
                enemies. The game is made in Typescript and is only playable on a desktop or laptop.</p>

            <h3>GrouPay</h3>
            <img src="img/groupay.png">

            <h4>Project</h4>
            <p>This is a project I started with a friend, whereby we wanted to create a mobile app to facilitate
                group
                payments in the catering industry. The idea is, when you go out for a drink with people, to create a
                group where everyone can individually order consumptions. The application will be linked with the
                company where you are consuming food and beverages. At all times there will be an overview of what
                everyone ordered and what everyone will have to pay. When its time to pay, the money will be written
                of
                their bank accounts individually and the payment will be done by smartphone. After a lot of
                brainstorming, research, interviews, designs and pitches we unfortunately cancelled this project due
                to
                a lack of time.
            </p>

            <h4>Final version</h4>
            <p>I created all designs for the app in Adobe XD. </p>
